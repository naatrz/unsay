## 🔍 Overview

Unsay is a personal tool designed to help you "unsay" your words on the internet. 🤫 </br>
The goal is to make it easier to delete your own messages or posts across different platforms — giving you back control over your digital footprint.

## 🔧 Features

At the current stage, Unsay works with Discord only, and it runs **via terminal**.
You can use it to delete your own messages from servers or direct messages, with no time limits — using your own user token.

> [!NOTE]
> 
> Future versions aim to support more platforms and feature a full desktop interface.
